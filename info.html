        <h2>Vincent Van Gogh</h2>
        <p>
          Self-Portrait (1889) This painting is also one of his many works that
          were created in the Saint-Paul asylum. The intense, swirling
          background contrasts with his calm yet deeply introspective
          expression. The use of bold colors—greens, blues, and reds—highlights
          his signature style of expressing emotion through color, rather than
          pure realism. Interestingly, this is one of several self-portraits Van
          Gogh painted, using himself as a model when he couldn’t afford others.
          His gaze, slightly off-center, seems to reflect both strength and
          vulnerability. This portrait is often seen as one of Van Gogh’s most
          personal works, capturing the emotional depth he experienced during
          his struggles with mental illness.

        <h2>Starry Night</h2>
        <p>
          Starry Night (1889) Perhaps Van Gogh’s most famous work, he painted
          Starry Night during his stay at the Saint-Paul asylum. What’s
          fascinating is that the swirling night sky wasn’t just
          imagined—Vincent painted it from memory, inspired by the view from his
          window. The swirling sky, glowing stars, and bold strokes capture
          movement and energy, reflecting his fascination with nature's forces.
          Despite its dreamlike beauty, Starry Night reflects Van Gogh’s inner
          turmoil. The dark cypress tree, symbolizing both death and hope, cuts
          through the scene, while the village below remains still and quiet—a
          contrast to the sky’s wild energy. Surprisingly, Van Gogh himself
          wasn’t a fan of the painting at first, calling it a "failure." Yet
          today, it’s one of the most celebrated artworks in the world.

        <h2>Café Terrace at Night</h2>
        <p>
          Café Terrace at Night (1888) Painted during Van Gogh’s stay in Arles,
          Café Terrace at Night captures a vibrant evening scene at a café in
          the Place du Forum. The warm glow of the café’s lights contrasts with
          the deep blues of the night sky, creating a sense of intimacy and
          mystery. What’s unique about this painting is how Van Gogh experiments
          with color and light, showing the night without using black—a bold
          choice at the time. This piece reflects Van Gogh’s growing fascination
          with the emotional power of color, a shift that would define many of
          his later works. It’s also one of the first paintings where he
          experimented with his famous "starry" night sky, which would soon lead
          to his iconic Starry Night.

        <h2>Bedroom in Arles</h2>
        <p>
          Bedroom in Arles (1888) Bedroom in Arles offers a glimpse into Van
          Gogh’s personal world, depicting his simple room in the Yellow House
          in Arles. The vivid reds, blues, and yellows create a sense of calm
          yet slight tension, reflecting both the comfort and loneliness Vincent
          felt at the time. What makes this painting stand out is Van Gogh’s use
          of color to express emotion rather than realism—the tilted perspective
          and flatness of the objects add to the dreamlike quality. It’s an
          intimate portrayal of a space that was both a retreat and a reflection
          of his inner struggles.

        <h2>Undergrowth with two figures</h2>
        <p>
          Undergrowth with two figures (1890) In the spring of 1890, just months
          before his death, Vincent left the South to be near his brother Theo’s
          family in Paris. He found the city too loud and felt his presence
          might disrupt their new life, so he settled in Auvers-sur-Oise, about
          30 minutes outside the city, under the care of a local doctor. During
          the summer, Vincent painted the picturesque landscapes around Auvers,
          trudging out into the countryside every day. These final works,
          including Undergrowth with Two Figures, showcase some of his most
          beautiful and poignant creations, reflecting his emotional intensity
          during this challenging time.

        <h2>First Steps</h2>
        <p>
          First Steps (January 1890) Struggles with his mental health led Van
          Gogh to admit himself to the psychiatric hospital of
          Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, located in the Romanesque monastery of
          Saint-Paul-de-Mausole. During his stay at the hospital, Vincent went
          through cycles of recovery and relapse. When he couldn't go outside to
          paint, he kept busy by reproducing works from other artists. First
          Step is one such example, a reimagining of Jean-François Millet’s 1858
          painting. Though it's a reproduction, Vincent’s unique style and
          vision shine through, giving new life to a classic.

        <h2>Vase with Red & White Carnations on a Yellow Background</h2>
        <p>
          Vase with Red & White Carnations on a Yellow Background (1886) In
          Paris, Vincent had a tough time finding models—either no one wanted to
          pose, or he couldn’t afford them. When his usual sources, like
          Parisian brothels, fell through, he turned to still lifes: flowers,
          books, plaster busts, and landscapes became his go-to subjects. Vase
          with Red & White Carnations on a Yellow Background is one example.
          While earthy tones dominate, those bright red carnations hint at his
          upcoming obsession with color. Paris wasn’t easy on Van Gogh. The
          local art scene shrugged him off, calling his self-taught style
          amateurish. Despite his brother Theo's connections, no one cared about
          his work. By the end, things got so bad that models refused to work
          with him, and even painting in public led to harassment from the
          police. Theo summed it up well: people either loved Vincent or found
          him impossible to deal with.

        <h2>Autumn Landscape</h2>
        <p>
          Autumn Landscape (October 1885) During his tough time in Neuen, Van
          Gogh painted moody, dark autumn landscapes, sticking to black, gray,
          and brown tones. But after clashing with locals, he left for Antwerp
          in late 1885. Everything changed when he moved to Paris in 1886.
          Inspired by artists like Gauguin and Monet, Vincent started
          experimenting with color. You'll see this transformation if you
          compare his earlier gloomy works to his later vibrant ones. A quick
          tip: If Van Gogh’s painting looks dark and shadowy, it’s probably from
          before 1886. After that, his art lights up with color!
